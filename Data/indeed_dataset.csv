Why Work at The Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research (CACR)?
Never Boring
CACR has a steady stream of new research and operational projects that provide ample opportunities to its staff for learning new areas and taking on new roles.
CACR is the lead for the National Science Foundation Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, and the NSF-Funded ResearchSOC, which bring cybersecurity expertise to open science, and give our analysts the opportunity to work with everything from high-speed networking, to aging and complex controls networks, to sensors under the ocean or under the Antarctic ice.
Reputation for Success
Founded in 2003, CACR has 18 years of success within IU and with securing research and operational funding from NSF, DOE, DOD, private sector firms. Through these and other projects, we are able to have real-world impact that reaches as far as the field of information security.
Real Growth
Professional development: CACR staff are supported in growing their professional and subject matter skills, and professional networks, with new opportunities constantly emerging through new projects. Each team receives a professional development budget to back up that commitment with both time and dollars: for training, conference attendance, and other learning resources.

INFORMATION SECURITY ANALYST - CORP. (Montgomery),Gray Television,"Montgomery, AL 36104•Remote",https://indeed.com/viewjob?jk=9128c90b25b8a946,None,"A rack-scale computer has an enormous attack surface including remote, physical, and supply chain attacks. Oxide takes a secure by design approach to incorporate threat modeling, risk assessment, and mitigation directly into product development.
As a security engineer working at Oxide, you will:
Work with a friendly and positive team that prioritizes security as a key feature, not an afterthought, to identify, assess, and mitigate security weaknesses in Oxide products in development.
Define product security goals and develop corresponding implementations throughout the stack from hardware to web UIs including areas as wide-ranging as verified boot chain, remote attestation, PKI infrastructure, REST APIs, BGP peering, overlay networking, hypervisor and VMM, integration with enterprise authentication and authorization systems, and manufacturing and supply chain.
Review Requests for Discussion to identify how a design can be misused and document assumptions and scenarios considered in the development of the design.
Partner with software and electrical engineers to navigate trade-offs between meeting security and other product goals and reach consensus on the best path forward.
Develop proof of concept implementations of both exploits and mitigation techniques.
Implement production-ready mitigations in Oxide-written and third-party code.
These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do – we can help you grow wherever your interests take you.
You will thrive in this role if you:
Apply both attacker and defender mindsets to problems.
Believe in fully documenting your ideas.
Enjoy reading the documentation produced by others.
Get excited about things and dig really deep into them.
Find a weakness, build consensus on a mitigation strategy, and then implement the mitigation.
Are very comfortable at a Unix terminal.
Don’t mind coworkers getting really excited about decades-old computer front panels.
If you don’t meet 100% of these qualifications you should still seriously consider applying – at least one of us was missing each of these at the outset!
Life at Oxide
We are very explicit about our values, and they can be seen in daily life at Oxide, for example:
Our rigor means we enjoy and take pride in the craft of engineering.
Our urgency means that we are not above the judicious short-cut.
Our versatility is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of our team.
Our transparency can be seen in our consensus-driven RFD process.
Our responsibility means that we both lead and follow: we have our own domains, but we also help others on their parts.
Our curiosity shows in our insatiable desire to learn – and our empathy in our love of teaching others.
Our humor is a big part of our daily lives: we are inveterate wise-crackers whose video meetings spill into simultaneous text chat.
Our values also manifest themselves in our benefits:
Everyone makes $180,250, regardless of location.
We offer the best health insurance we could find: medical PPO plan, dental, and vision that are 100% covered for both employees and dependents.
We are very supportive of remote work. About half of our team is outside of the San Francisco Bay Area; our only requirement is working hours with a significant overlap with Pacific Time.
Our families and lives outside of our jobs are very important to us; our schedules are flexible to reflect and support that."

Netflix is the world’s leading streaming entertainment service with 204 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments.
About the Security Operations Team
As Netflix has grown, so has our approach to security operations. For a considerable time, a strategy of building around human operations work kept us from investing in a traditional Security Operations Center (SOC). As organizational size and complexity, cross-spectrum threats (i.e., physical), and non-automatable security events have increased, so has the demand for an expert information security operations team, or a SOC. As one of the founding members of our newly forming Security Operations team, you will have tremendous influence over the vision, implementation, and operations of the SOC.
The Role
For this role, we are looking for a curious and innovative Senior Security Operations Engineer with a passion for information security operations and automation development. You will be responsible for responding to and investigating security alerts and proactively hunting for malicious activity across the organization. You will develop and maintain tools, detections, automations, runbooks, processes, analytics, dashboards, and metrics to support rapid detection, triage, analysis, and response to potential security threats.

Our ideal new team member has first-hand experience working in or supporting a SOC or “SOCLess” environment and has a breadth of experience across the information security domain. You are good at understanding and solving complex and ambiguous problems and constantly seek improvement.
What you’ll need to be successful:
You have excellent written and verbal communications skills.
You possess a breadth of knowledge and experience across the information security domain, such as endpoint security, SIEM, IDS, identity management, vulnerability management, incident response, and threat intelligence.
You have hands-on experience analyzing and responding to security events, such as conducting log analysis, developing queries and analytics, troubleshooting security issues, and correlating diverse data sets.
You have experience in developing and implementing security tools and managing infrastructure.
You have some experience in system and network administration across multiple platforms and environments, to include AWS.
You seek out process improvement opportunities through automation.
You have experience providing excellent customer service across a complex organization, ideally as part of a central support team.
Netflix allows the security team to approach security differently. We’ve shaped our security principles to align with our culture of “Freedom and Responsibility” and “Context not Control.” Employees have tremendous freedom in their work, along with the corresponding responsibility and the accountability to do the right thing for Netflix. Read more about the Netflix culture here.
We are an equal opportunity employer and celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity of thought and background builds stronger teams. We approach diversity and inclusion seriously and thoughtfully. We do not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Why Cisco Security?
Cisco delivers intelligent cybersecurity for the real world, providing one of the industry's most comprehensive advanced threat protection portfolio that is integrated, pervasive, continuous, and open. Cisco's threat-centric approach to security reduces complexity while providing unmatched visibility, continuous control, and advanced threat protection across the entire attack continuum -- before, during, and after an attack.

Global Security Sales Organization (GSSO) - GSSO is taking big steps to position Cisco as the #1 IT Security provider in the industry. In addition to having the right market conditions, capabilities, products, and services, we need the right people to take us there.

Why Cisco?
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
