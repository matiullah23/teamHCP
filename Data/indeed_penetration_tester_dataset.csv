Job Description

A successful Red Team consultant at Mandiant should possess an understanding of both information security and computer science. They should understand basic concepts such as networking, applications, and operating system functionality and be able to learn advanced concepts such as application manipulation, exploit development, and stealthy operations. This is not a “press the ‘pwn’ button” type of job; this career is technical and challenging with opportunities to work in some of the most exciting areas of security consulting on extremely technical and challenging work. A typical job could be breaking into a segmented secure zone at a Fortune 500 bank, reverse engineering an application and encryption method in order to gain access to sensitive data, all without being detected. If you can exploit at scale while remaining stealthy, identify and exploit misconfigurations in network infrastructure, parse various types of output data, present relevant data in a digestible manner, think well outside the box, or are astute enough to quickly learn these skills, then you’re the type of consultant we’re looking for.
As a Mandiant consultant, you’ll get hands-on experience with complex problems on a daily basis. We help our clients protect their most sensitive and valuable data through comprehensive and real-world scenario testing. The objective doesn’t end at gaining “domain admin” or “root”; this is expected and is only a starting point.
You are expected to quickly assimilate new information as you will face new client environments on a weekly or monthly basis. You will be expected to understand all the threat vectors to each environment and properly assess them. You will get to work with some of the best red teamers in the industry, causing you to develop new skills as you progress through your career. Are you up to the challenge?
What You Will Do:
Perform network penetration, web and mobile application testing, source code reviews, threat analysis, wireless network assessments, and social-engineering assessments
Develop comprehensive and accurate reports and presentations for both technical and executive audiences
Effectively communicate and discuss findings and strategy with internal stakeholders including leadership and technical team members
Recognize and safely utilize attacker tools, tactics, and procedures
Develop scripts, tools, or methodologies to enhance Mandiant’s red teaming processes

Qualifications

Minimum Requirements:
1+ years’ experience, via internships, classes, projects and similar, in at least three of the following:
Network penetration testing and manipulation of network infrastructure
Mobile and/or web application assessments
Email, phone, or physical social-engineering assessments
Shell scripting or automation of simple tasks using Perl, Python, or Ruby
Developing, extending, or modifying exploits, shellcode or exploit tools
Developing applications in C#, ASP, .NET, ObjectiveC, Go, or Java (J2EE)
Reverse engineering malware, data obfuscators, or ciphers
Source code review for control flow and security flaws
1+ years’ exposure working with tools used for wireless, web application, and network security testing
Understanding of network protocols, data on the wire, and covert channels
Understanding of Unix/Linux/Mac/Windows operating systems, including bash and Powershell
Must be eligible to work in the US without sponsorship
Preferred Qualifications:
Prior experience in a technical security internship
Experience in security competitions, CTFs and/or testing platforms such as Hack the Box, TryHackMe, Overthewire, etc
Related projects around cybersecurity, programming, etc
Strong technical acumen and ability to quickly assimilate new information
Ability to successfully interface with clients (internal and external) and manage expectations of others
Ability to document and explain technical details in a concise, understandable manner

Job Description

A successful Red Team consultant at FireEye should possess a deep understanding of both information security and computer science. They should understand basic concepts such as networking, applications, and operating system functionality and be able to learn advanced concepts such as application manipulation, exploit development, and stealthy operations. This is not a “press the ‘pwn’ button” type of job; this career is technical and challenging with opportunities to work in some of the most exciting areas of security consulting on extremely technical and challenging work. A typical job could be breaking into a segmented secure zone at a Fortune 500 bank, reverse engineering an application and encryption method in order to gain access to sensitive data, all without being detected. If you can exploit at scale while remaining stealthy, identify and exploit misconfigurations in network infrastructure, parse various types of output data, present relevant data in a digestible manner, think well outside the box, or are astute enough to quickly learn these skills, then you’re the type of consultant we’re looking for.
At FireEye, you’ll be faced with complex problem solving opportunities and hands-on testing opportunities on a daily basis. We help our clients protect their most sensitive and valuable data through comprehensive and real world scenario testing.

You are expected to quickly assimilate new information as you will face new client environments on a weekly or monthly basis. You will be expected to understand all the threat vectors to each environment and properly assess them. You will get to work with some of the best red teamers in the industry, causing you to develop new skills as you progress through your career. Are you up to the challenge?
Responsibilities:
Perform network penetration, web and mobile application testing, source code reviews, threat analysis, wireless network assessments, and social-engineering assessments
Develop comprehensive and accurate reports and presentations for both technical and executive audiences
Effectively communicate findings and strategy to client stakeholders including technical staff, executive leadership, and legal counsel
Recognize and safely utilize attacker tools, tactics, and procedures
Develop scripts, tools, or methodologies to enhance FireEye Mandiant’s red teaming processes
Assist with scoping prospective engagements, leading engagements from kickoff through remediation, and mentoring less experienced staff
